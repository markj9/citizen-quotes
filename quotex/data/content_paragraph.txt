104702,13661,"The good news started with some wins last year. A handful of beach lovers and staff at McGrath State Beach near Ventura raised half a million dollars for the new sewage system that is keeping that park open. And a nonprofit, the Coe Park Preservation Fund, raised more than a million dollars to protect its namesake park near San Jose.",0,1,,1,
104703,13661,"Institutional neighbors stepped up, too. The National Park Service has pledged to keep Tomales Bay, Samuel P. Taylor, and Del Norte Coast Redwoods state parks open for at least a year. Counties and cities have offered to provide services at parks within their borders.",0,2,,1,

104705,13661,"At the same time, promising and dedicated grassroots leaders have emerged. To name a few: Greg Hayes, a former state park superintendent, has forsaken retirement to try to rescue Jack London Historic State Park; Kathy Bailey, a longtime resident of Northern California's Anderson Valley, is devoting her days to working with her neighbors to keep Hendy Woods State Park open; Robert Hanna, not long ago a sales manager in a financial firm, has teamed up with activists at several state parks to ""do everything I can to help keep parks open."" Perhaps Hanna was destined to be a leader; he is John Muir's 31-year-old great-great grandson. Somehow this crisis has led him and dozens of other Californians to a new calling: preserving state parks.",1,4,,1,9
104706,13661,"Inside and outside the bureaucracy, the crisis has highlighted some not-so-new ideas. At Samuel P. Taylor State Park, in Marin, supervising ranger Rose Blackburn is reassessing her use of volunteer campground hosts. In exchange for free RV space, they work 20 hours a week helping park visitors and handling emergencies. In peak season, she now has two campground hosts and may expand that to three or four, with one host concentrating on maintenance. One surefire revenue enhancement at Taylor is a new lodging option: five new primitive cabins that she hopes will be ready for visitors this summer, at $100 a night or so (compared with $35 for a campsite).",0,5,,1,
104707,13661,"In the past, some parks neglected collecting fees, partly because the revenue went to Sacramento to be shared among all the parks. Now new models are being explored. At Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve, for example, the nonprofit Bodie Foundation will collect a $3 parking fee to be invested right back into Mono.",0,7,,1,
104708,13661,"Save the Redwoods League's  executive director Ruskin Hartley said basic entry fees to state parks should be kept low to ensure people can afford to visit, ""but that doesn't mean you should pay the same amount to camp on July 4th as you would on January 4th.""",1,8,,1,21

104710,13661,"""We'd start by bringing out kids from every single school in Santa Rosa within walking distance,"" said LandPaths' executive director Craig Anderson .

104711,13661,"The Napa County parks department has suggested pooling government resources to run parks more efficiently. For example, the county sheriff might set up a substation on state park land in exchange for keeping an eye on Bothe-Napa State Park. Cities and counties have also offered to help with trash pickup and other services on state park lands near facilities they already manage.",0,11,,1,
104712,13661,"The state Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) also had efficiency in mind when it challenged a rule requiring all state park rangers to have peace-officer (police) training. As a March 2012 LAO report states, ""While some ranger duties, such as responding to emergencies and making arrests, require peace officer status, many of them do not (such as managing staff, providing information to visitors, and leading school groups on tours)."" Reducing the number of peace officers could reduce state parks' expenses by at least a few million dollars, the report said.",1,12,,1,35
104713,13661,"A few additional millions could be garnered by the passage of the California State Parks Stewardship Act of 2012, A.B. 1589. Introduced by Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) in February, the bill would allow residents to buy an annual state park pass when filing tax returns, and introduces a special state park license plate. It also sets up a fund that would pool $25 million in unused bond money to pay for the installation of revenue and fee collection equipment and technologies to increase park visitation and revenues, among other measures. The bill passed out of its first committee unanimously last week.",0,13,,1,
104714,13661,"This is just a small sampling of the promising ideas that have emerged in the past few months. They are not enough to counter the problems that will arise from the state's meat-ax approach to budget cutting. Dozens of parks are expected to close on July 1, and they will be damaged―perhaps permanently. The jury is still out on whether closures  will actually save money.",0,14,,1,
104715,13661,"But the shock of closures has also had its benefits, moving California toward  more government  cooperation, energized nonprofit leadership, and generous private contributions of time and money. The parks idea of the early 20th century is being updated for the 21st century with broad, sometimes angry, but decidedly engaged public participation. People are joining their neighbors. They're reconnecting with their parks.",0,15,,1,

Barnes confirmed that five people were detained, but said that no arrests were made.",0,4,,1,
104720,13662,"The raids come as Lee's battle with U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag escalated. Last fall, Haag ordered Lee's dispensary, Coffeeshop Blue Sky to move because it was too close to a school, as the Bay Citizen first reported. But instead of closing the dispensary, as many other pot club owners have done, Lee moved it first two doors down and then later into the building where the Oaksterdam museum is located.",0,5,,1,

104722,13662,"Protesters gathered outside Oaksterdam as the operation continued into the late morning. They chanted ""Free Richard Lee"" and screamed in the faces of the agents. One even called the Oakland Police Department to report that a robbery was in progress at the university.",0,7,,1,

104740,13663,"Gone are the days of a school nurse sitting in an office waiting to give a student a band-aid. ""We have one of the lowest school nurse ratios in the country,"" Clayton said. Today, school nurses are integrating into school-based health centers.",1,14,,1,12

104744,13663,"Providing mental health services is the biggest challenge at the clinics. ""You can't get anybody to pay for them,"" Trinclisti said. ""Mental health is more needed than any other single support for kids in schools.""",1,19,,1,22
104745,13663,"The unmet needs for mental health services and dental access have been the largest complaints about the health care system over the years, Serena Clayton said. Recently, there's been more funding for dental programs, primarily for prevention, screening, varnish and sealants.",0,20,,1,
104746,13663,"School-based health centers, Clayton said, are the epitome of the principals of health care reform—to transform the way health care is delivered through inexpensive preventative care. Little of the funding for school-based clinics, however, came from the Affordable Care Act.",0,21,,1,
104747,13663,"The Affordable Care Act did provide $100 million for significant and pressing capital needs to improve delivery and support expansion of services at school-based health centers in 2011.

104749,13663,"A $399,260 grant to the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency covered some furniture and equipment expenses. A $423,098 grant went to Oakland Unified School District to add an additional portable to the clinic at Oakland Technical High School, doubling their square footage.",0,24,,1,
104750,13663,"The grant will also make it possible for an East Oakland-based community clinic, La Clincia De La Raza, to switch to electronic health records (EHR) at the five school-based health centers they run. All clinics will be expected to switch to EHR by the time health care reform is fully implemented in 2014.",0,25,,1,
104751,13663,"The development of school-based health centers is more of a locally funded effort with $14 million of the $18 million initiative in Oakland coming from voter approved school bonds, Alex Briscoe said.",0,26,,1,

""We couldn't find a player that could handle 42 hours of video,"" said Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher, the exhibition's curator.

104841,13669,"Yet his underlying notion of doing ""the most with the least"" — streamlining the car like an airplane for maximum efficiency — was decades ahead of Ford's steel-trap thinking, an example of anticipatory design (synthesizing art, science, engineering and economics) if ever there was one. By the 1960s, Fuller had found a mass audience, not within the auto industry but within the emerging counterculture, for which the idea of doing less with more was apposite. He gave lectures of epic length,  inspiring renegades half his age to act on his beliefs.",0,4,,1,

From Brand's LSD-enhanced perspective, Fuller preached self-sufficiency, which Brand sought to realize via his catalog — a mail-order sourcebook for everything from hunting boots to CB radios. ""I was persuaded by Fuller that tools and techniques were the essence of human progress,"" he wrote in an email, ""whereas politics often was a complete distraction.""",1,6,,1,33

The soccer ball deceptively looks like a piece of trash floating in the water, which protects the mussels from thieves.",,1,,0,
105764,13716,"The mussels will give scientists and the EPA an estimate of how much DDT—a carcinogenic and nerve-damaging chemical—is left in the area. The chemical is a part of a toxic stew left behind by the chemical company United-Heckathorn when it went bankrupt and abandoned the site in 1966. The EPA cleared more than three tons of pure DDT in 1996 during a massive cleanup effort. But it didn't completely clean the area. The Lauritzen Channel has more DDT in it than before the 1996 cleanup, and some fish are turning up with DDT levels in their tissues hundreds of times higher than their counterparts in the rest of the San Francisco Bay. It took one company less than two decades to create a chemical mess in the Lauritzen Channel that will take almost half a century to identify and clean.",,2,,0,
105765,13716,"In 1947, Prentiss & Co., a New York based chemical company, sent Eugene Heckathorn to Richmond to supervise a DDT-grinding plant, meant not for manufacturing but for processing and distribution, on the Lauritzen Channel. He intended to stay in California for only a short time, but he liked the West. He bought the DDT-grinding plant from Prentiss and quickly merged with United Chemical Co. to start an insecticide company—United-Heckathorn. ""Heckathorn soon built a reputation for doing the jobs no one else wanted,"" boasted one article in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry in 1958.",,3,,0,
105766,13716,"Though United Heckathorn worked with other chemicals, like dieldrin, processing DDT accounted for 95 percent of its business. United Heckathorn imported technical grade DDT from Montrose Chemical Corporation and Shell Oil Company ground it into a powder in air mills or chemically converted it to a liquid. The company then packaged and shipped it out as an agricultural insecticide and as a combatant to malaria. United Heckathorn expanded exponentially and by 1958 it was producing more than 25 billion pounds of liquid DDT and enough insecticide to treat more than eight million acres of farmland.",,4,,0,
105767,13716,"The dangers of DDT weren't known while United-Heckathorn was an active company, but now, decades later, scientists have extensively studied and documented the dangers. The United States banned DDT in 1972 after studies linked exposure to breast cancer, diabetes, miscarriages, and neurodevelopment problems in children. It resists organic decay, persisting in an ecosystem for decades. As fish and plants absorb the chemicals into their tissue and cells, and birds eat them, they spread the chemicals through the food chain, creating a perpetually dangerous cycle.",,5,,0,
105768,13716,"United-Heckathorn's housekeeping policies, though, reflected the ignorance of the time. These chemicals weren't considered dangerous and even if they were, no one was there to scold them or stop them. ""It was a little bit of a standard of the time,"" said Rusty Harris-Bishop, a superfund division liaison for the EPA. ""Folks just didn't pay attention to that sort of thing.""",,6,,0,
105769,13716,"When employees dumped the powder form of DDT from one transport container to another, clouds of dust flew out and spread over the area. Pipes running under the Lauritzen Channel leaked and spills weren't cleaned.",,10,,0,
105770,13716,"In 1966, United-Heckathorn went out of business and abandoned its factory on the Richmond harbor. A few years later, the buildings were demolished and shortly afterward dead fish started floating to the top of the water. The California Department of Fish and Game noticed a milky liquid oozing from Lauritzen Channel. While the EPA's Penny Reddy isn't sure if the dead fish and the DDT were related, she said it was a red flag that the ecosystem wasn't healthy.",,12,,0,
105771,13716,"In 1982 the EPA declared the Lauritzen Channel a superfund site, meaning it is officially designated as a hazardous site in need of serious cleanup. In 1990, the EPA put it on the national priorities list. Six years later, the EPA dredged the bay, cleared soil from the site, and put concrete caps on some areas. It cleaned three tons of pure DDT from a 100,000 cubic yard area and cleared three feet of pure product from the top portion of the soil.",,13,,0,
105772,13716,"But dredging and cleaning equipment wasn't as effective then as it is now, and large amounts of contaminants were left in place. For example, the EPA couldn't reach areas under piles of scrap metal, under docks, or near barriers. It also turns out that the clamshell dredges used to pull up mud ended up spraying water and sediment everywhere.",,14,,0,
105773,13716,"""What we have learned since then is that 50 percent of those efforts have failed,"" said Kelly Manheimer, EPA site manager for the Heckathorn Site. ""We didn't know that at the time. We thought it was the perfect thing to do.""",,15,,0,
105774,13716,"Years of boats coming in and out of the bay shuffled the soil on the bottom and DDT spread throughout the channel again. By 2011, DDT concentrations exceeded 1994 levels. Something had to be done.",,16,,0,
105775,13716,"Cleaning up old industrial sites is tedious. Before the process can start, the EPA needs to run tests. And without accurate maps, in this case marking where United-Heckathorn stored and processed DDT, the agency has to play detective to determine where the highest levels of pollution might be. They are testing the soil and water, and even using mussels to measure the pollution levels. Mussels are natural barometers for aquatic health because they are static and absorb everything in the water flowing past. The EPA gathered mussels from Bodega Bay, a relatively clean area, and put them in the Lauritzen Channel for a month. At the end of the month, the EPA officials stood on the edge of the dock and watched a scuba diver emerge and hand over a muddy bag of mussels to a scientist in a pontoon boat before pulling himself up.",,17,,0,
105776,13716,"A scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will examine the mussels, but the results won't be ready until July. And then they will have to be bundled with sedimentation and water samples before the EPA can start to draft a cleanup plan, which has to go through its own bureaucratic loopholes before it can implemented. ""We have this whole process,"" Redding said. The EPA won't actually start dredging and cleaning until 2015 and even then, it will likely take many years.",,18,,0,
